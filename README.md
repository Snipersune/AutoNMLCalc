# AutoNMLCalc

Attempt at making an MDL principle (Minimum Description Length) framework which will automatically provide NML codelength approximations of probabilistic parametric models. The purpose is to remove the need of an MDL practitioner to create and provide custom model class code schemes, facilitating and generalizing the use of the MDL principle.
